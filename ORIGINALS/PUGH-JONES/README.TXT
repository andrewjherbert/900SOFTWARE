PUGH-JONES Archive
==================

This folder contains images of paper tapes belonging
to Mr Christopher Pugh-Jones of St Albans, Herts.  As
a student he used an ICL1900, Elliott 803 and 
903 computers and has kept as souvenirs paper tapes
of his programs form that time.  The tapes in this
folder are the 903 and 1900 tapes, mostly Algol 60
and City and Guilds Mnemonic Code.  Some of the latter
have been used as demonstrations for the Mnemonic Code
compiler in the Elliott simulator elsewhere in this 
archive.

It is thought that some of the Mnemonic Code tapes were
for use on the ICL1900 which had a less strict view on
seperating instructions and data than the Elliott version
and therefore produce errors on the latter, but may well
have worked correctly on the 1900.

The original paper tapes remain in the custody of 
Mr Pugh-Jones.
