This folder contains images of paper tapes held
by Andrew Herbert.  These mostly comprise tapes 
originally held by Don Hunter and now retained by 
Andrew.  

In addition there are images of tapes held at The 
National Museum of sComputing (TNMoC).

Not all of Don Hunter's paper tapes have been read in:
in the main only Elliott issued software and those of
Don's programs which are of more general interest are
in this collection.  A large number of obsolete 
versions of Elliott software and Don's personal
programs remain to be read.
