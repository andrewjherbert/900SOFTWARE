This folder contains images of paper tapes from
the collection held by Terry Froggatt.  Terry
advises he still has several more boxes to read in. 

The tapes are a mixture of standard Elliott issued
tapes, tapes issued by the Elliott Automation
Airborne Computing Dvision (where Terry worked at
one time) to its customers, code for some of the systems 
Terry worked on and tapes he collected from other 
users oor wrote himself.

The folder OTHER contains tapes Terry has given to 
others which are not (yet) in his "catalogue".
