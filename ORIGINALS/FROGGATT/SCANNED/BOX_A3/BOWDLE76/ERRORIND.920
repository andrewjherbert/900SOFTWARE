                        BOWDLER ERROR INDICATIONS.

                        A: Haltcode found whilst declaring repeditive group,
                           possibly because an END is missing.

                        B: Not all repeditive groups have been cancelled,
                           some REP has no matching CAN.

                        C: Haltcode found whilst in comment,
                           possibly because a closing bracket is missing.

                        D: Haltcode found within a command,
                           possibly because an insert string
                           is incorrectly terminated.

                        E: Unrecognised command mnemonic.

                        F: More than 120 characters
                           in matching string or in line of main tape,
                           there are no such limits on insert strings.

                        G: Telecode commands not at start of steering tape.

                        H: Another REP found nested in repeditive group,
                           possibly because an END is missing.

                        I: A CAN found in a repeditive group,
                           could cause edit-time suicide,
                           perhaps END was intended.

                        J: A COP found in a repeditive group,
                           COP cancels all repeditive groups,
                           so would cause edit-time suicide.

                        K: An END found outside a repeditive group,
                           perhaps COP or PSC was intended.

                        L: Repeditive group contains no instructions,
                           END directly follows REP.

                        M: First instruction inside a repeditive group
                           is not a copy instruction.

                        N: Repeditive group does not cause input to advance,
                           and so will be executed repeatedly.

                        O: Not exactly one label character following REP or CAN.

                        P: Label following CAN has never been declared by a REP,
                           or has already been CANcelled.

                        Q: Label following REP has been used in an earlier REP,
                           and has not yet been CANcelled.

                        R: More than 32 repeditive groups active at once.

                        S: Spurious characters on same line as command mnemonic,
                           where none is expected.

                        T: No string on same line as command mnemonic,
                           where one is expected.

                        U: More than 3 characters in escape sequence.

                        V: Spurious characters following the terminating
                           sequence of an insertion string.

                        W: Haltcode found whilst attempting a match,
                           steering tape string not found in main tape.

                        X: Steering tape command buffer full.
