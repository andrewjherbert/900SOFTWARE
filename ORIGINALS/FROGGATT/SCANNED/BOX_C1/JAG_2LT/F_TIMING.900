((FUNCTION TIMING TEST, 15/9/72)

(Using the level 2 interrupts, this routine checks
that the instruction times are all within 10 percent
of their nominal value. This permitted 20 percent
variation is mainly caused by the computer clock
which affects all instructions simultaneously. Accordingly
a more rigorous test is performed on the SPREAD
of the departures of the instruction times from nominal.
Function 0 is not tested since interrupt is not
possible after this function)

(Table of instructions to be tested & correct times for
fast 920M. The sign of the time column is used to indicate
the significance of the instruction address column)
