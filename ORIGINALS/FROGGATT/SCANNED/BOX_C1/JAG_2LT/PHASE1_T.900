((JAGUAR SECOND-LINE TEST PHASE 1, 16/9/72)

(This program performs both a store-chequerboard test
and a store-addressing test on a 920M computer with
a fast 8192-word store; and it may also be used to
perform a store-retention test. Thus it performs the
functions of X17, 1/1/71, and X4, 1/1/71, combined.
The chequerboard and addressing tests are both
performed with an appropriate bit-pattern and its inverse.
The whole store from location 2 to location 8176
is tested using 2 copies of the test program.
The first copy occupies locations 102 to 201 when in use,
and tests locations 202 to 8176; during which time
the second copy is saved in locations 2 to 101.
The second copy occupies locations 7977 to 8076 when in use,
and tests locations 2 to 7976; during which time
the first copy is saved in locations 8077 to 8176.
Of the remaining locations, 0 & 1 and 8178 & 8179
are tested by continual use during the test,
8180 to 8191 are initial instructions not needing test,
and 8177, the autostart location, is tested as such)
