((INTERRUPTS THRESHOLD TEST, 5/9/72)

(Below-threshold tests are presumed to be performed first;
the program then waits until the level-sequence given
in LLIST has been obeyed. Levels 2 & 3 are each obeyed
for 5 seconds before terminating. An illegal level causes
a failure exit, bypassing these delays)

(List of levels to be entered)

LLIST    +3 +4 +2 +4 +3 +2 +3 +4 +0

(Reset addresses)

AFAIL3   0    IFAIL3

(Workspaces)

PLIST    >1   (List pointer)
LEVEL    >1   (Current level)

(Level 4: Initialise list pointer and current level,
and permit entry to levels 2 & 3)

then ignore further interrupts)

level 2 or 3 to this point)
