(DATA INPUT THRESHOLD TEST)

(The program waits for 18 replies with data below
threshold; and then for 18 replies with data above
threshold, each bit being present in turn)

(Workspaces)

DITHW    >1   (Count & Expected data)

(Below-threshold test)

DITH     4    +1
DITH1    5    DITHW

         9    DITH2
         1    DITHW

(DATA OUTPUT THRESHOLD TEST)

(The program generates all-zero data until first reply,
then all-ones data until the second)

DOTH     4    +0
         15   4096

         8    SWITCH

(ADDRESS OUTPUT THRESHOLD TEST)

(The program generates all-zero address lines until
first reply, then all-ones address lines until the
second)

AOTH     4    +0
