((DYNAMIC INTERRUPTS TEST, 14/9/72)

(Checks that roughly the correct number of
level 2 & 3 interrupts are received in one minute,
and checks that their ratio is exactly 1:10)

(Reset addresses)

AFAIL    0    IFAIL

ITIME    >1   (Timing count)
IL2CT    >1   (Level 2 interrupt count)
IL3CT    >1   (Level 3 interrupt count)

(Level 4: Initialises counts and permits entry to levels 2 & 3)
