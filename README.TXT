900 Software
------------

       The software archive consists of two folders.

       The ORIGINALS folder contains two sub-folders, IMAGES and
SCANNED, each with parallel sub-folder structures, with a sub-folder
for each source of paper tapes in the archive.

       IMAGES contains 8 bit byte images of the original paper tapes.
SCANNED contains the result of running these through my ScanTapes
program which attempts to guess the specific paper tape code of each
image and translates it to a UTF-8 representation for text files and
a numeric format for binary files.

       The ARCHIVE folder is a re-organisation of the tapes from the
ORIGINALS/SCANNED folder into sub-folders for related groups of
programs.  In some cases, the files have been corrected to remove
errors arising from damage to the original tapes, misreads and so
forth.
