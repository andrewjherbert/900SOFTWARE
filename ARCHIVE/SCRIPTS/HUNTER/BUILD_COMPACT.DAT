C **********TAPE 2**********

c TAPE 2 contains five components:
c
c The assembled interpreter in locations    8-3359
c The built-in library      in locations 3360-3939
c A RLB loader              in locations 7542-8000
c The ALGOL dump utility    in locations 8001-8101
c The ALGOL T23 loader      in locations 8135-8179
c
c The dump utility allows a new TAPE 2 to be made after
c additional procedures have been loaded into the library
c table.  It outputs a binary clear store, then a T23 like 
c loader followed by a store image in T22-23 like format. The
c dump utility is essentially a specialized version of T22.
c 
c The build sequence is as follows:
c
c 1.	Assemble the RLB loader, dump utility and ALGOL T23 
c 	loader using SIR in low store.
c 2.	Dump out the loaders and dump as binary using QBINOUT
c 3.	Assemble the interpreter using SIR in high store and
c	output as RLB (the interpreter is too big to assemble
c	'load and go').  Specify that an RLB loader is to
c	be punched first on the tape.
c 2.	Assemble the built-in library to RLB using SIR in
c	high store.
c 5.	Load in sequence, interpreter, RLB loader, dump, T23
c	loader
c		Note the symbols, dump and loader binary will
c		overwrite the RLB loader used to load the
c		translator.
c 6.	Load the built-in library at 12
c 7.	Enter at 14 to run the dump utility and produce a
c	new TAPE 2. 
c
c Note we zealously clear store before each assembly etc to
c ensure the result is a clean translator.
