Notes on Programs
-----------------


903_MUSIC
---------

Input:

A-G notes. ^ to raise by an octave. ' for sharp, @ for flat. R for rest.
S to stop. Digit for duration.


AJH_MUSIC
---------

Input as TJF_MUSIC with addition of:
&n slow down by 10n%.
* double tempo.
/ halve tempo.

       8       Read in music tape and play repeatedly
       9       Read in music tape and play once then read next tape.

Autotriggers to 9.

MAESTRO
-------

        8      Assemble music tape
        9      Continue after error
       10      Play currently loaded tune
       11      Load new dictionary
       12      Dump currently loaded tune
       13      Load dumped tune


TJF_MUSIC
---------

        8      Load score.
        9      Select loudspeaker output.
       10      Select DAC output.

Input: pitch-&-duration pairs terminated by halt code.  Requires initial newline.

Letters A to G are one scale, H to N the next up, etc. as far as Z.
Letters a to z are semitones higher.
Follow these by $ to go up a semitone (esp. if you don't have lower case),
Follow these by + or - to go up or down one or more octaves.

Symbols above Z or z, e.g., {\} treated as rests.

Duration is 0 to 9 onwards in ASCII, so < is simply 12 intervals.
