Programs from Paul Wood, donated to the Centre for 
Computing History.

Paul was at Dover Grammer School at around the same time
I was at Gillingham Grammar School and like me used the
Elliott 903 at the Medway and Maidstone College of
Technology via a postal and later dial-up service.

The programs are typical examples of schoolboy programming.

The program names represent the naming scheme used by the
College to relate programs back to the school submitting them.
