This folder contains files relating to MASD ALGOL as distributed by Terry 
Froggatt.

Terry made these by patching the Elliott 903 ALGOL tapes (Issue 6 for all but 
the Load and Go System, for which Issue 5 applies).

His tapes for doing this are in the archive so it should be possible to
reconstruct the derivation.
