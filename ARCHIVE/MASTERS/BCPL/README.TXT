
This folder is intended to contain files for making a BCPL system.

Experiments by Terry Froggatt suggest the translated OCODE of the BCPL
compiler is too big for even a 16K 903, so I intend to try a port of
the obsolete version that produces INTCODE.

INTCODE.900 is a first attempt at an INTCODE interpreter.
