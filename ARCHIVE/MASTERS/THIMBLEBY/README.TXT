THIMBLEBY
=========

This folder contains programs from Harold Thimbleby who
used a 903 and 905 while a student at Queen Elizabeth
College, London in the mid 1970s.  (The 905 was at the
Royal College of Art).

The programs here are slightly tidied versions of the
original tapes, which can be found in the 
HERBERT/ORIGINALS/THIMBLEBY folder.  Minimal changes
have been made to allow the programs to be compiled and
run and a few significant bugs removed.
