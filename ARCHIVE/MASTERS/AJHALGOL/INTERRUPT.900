((INTERRUPT - ANDREW HERBERT - 26/03/2015)

("code" "procedure" interrupt; "algol";

Adds an interrupt facility to AJH ALGOL.

It sets up an interrupt routine such that when a level 1 
interrupt occurs while an Algol program is running, the program
is forced to execute a WAIT as its next pord.  On continuation 
from the WAIT execution continues from the point of interruption)
