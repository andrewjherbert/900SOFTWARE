This folder contains the Aldenham School software written
by Chris Moller.

First there is a set of useful utilities, U.1, U.2, etc.

Second there are a number of line editors, of which versions 8P
and 9C4 have been tested.

U UTILITIES
-----------

U.1 - READIT   - decode scb tapes
U.2 - PUNCHIT  - punch scb tapes
U.3 - STORE    - print out contents of store
U.4 - MAP      - print store map
U.5 - ALDCOPY  - copy paper tapes
U.6 - ALDRLB    - convert T22/23 tapes to AldRLB format
U.7 - UNIDUMP-B- dump store to paper tape
U.8 - UNIDUMP-C - dump store to paper tape (2 pass)
U.9 - UNIDUMP-D - dump selected areas of store to tape

The sources for U.1 to U.8 are from the tape "U Series 
Anthology Source Code" found in Don Hunter's tapes.

The binaries for all except U.6 were recovered from the tape 
"U ANTHOLOGY" found in Don Hunter's tapes.

IOPACK.900 is the Aldenham School IO library.

A copy of Chris Moller's handwritten specification for the
utilities is in the manuals folder.

Examples of using the utilities are included in the simulator
demonstrations.

EDITORS
-------

A number of versions of a sophisticated line editor were found 
in Don Hunter's tapes, of which versions 8P and 9C4 have been
tested. For each version there is source code and a
corresponding binary.  A help file for 8P is also available. 

I have made a separate note of the changes between8P and 9C4
