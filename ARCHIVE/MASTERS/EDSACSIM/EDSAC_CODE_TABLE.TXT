Character codes in use with EDSAC.
I found these to be confusing when I started working on
the EDSAC replica. The First two columns show the codes
used on paper tape. There was no way of distinguishing
letters from digits! You can write P instead of 0 and
EDSAC cannot tell the difference. The actual holes in
the paper tape are given in the column labelled Binary
except that the first bit is inverted. Blank tape therefore
gives 10000, and erase (all five holes punched) gives 01111.

The Printer codes are more conventional, with LS and FS being
letter shift and figure shift, CR and LF being carriage return
and line feed, and SP being the space character.

For inputs to either simulator (Elsie or Martin's) use only
letters and digits. The layout and greek characters use the
ASCII substitutes as shown in the right hand column. Space,
Newline can be used to make tape files more legible and are
ignored.
