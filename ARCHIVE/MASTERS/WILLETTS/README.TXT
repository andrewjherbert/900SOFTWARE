Descr: Elliott 905 Algol 60 and S.I.R. (simple!)
programs on paper tape.

ALGOL7 ALGOL   Tabulates exp x -ln (4x+1) + sin cos 2x.

BINARY ALGOL   Converts decimal numbers to floating
               point binary form. (Called ALGOL3 in
               ORIGINALS/WILLETTS).

EX4    SIR     Reads in a simple form of dictionary
               and then looks up entries. N.B. uses
               905 instruction set.  Data is in 
               EX4DATA.

PRACT4 ALGOL   Program to read in a database of 
               country statistics and then answer
               queries. 

SIR1   SIR     Simple student exercise to read in
               numbers and print out multiples.
               Data is in SIR1DATA.

SIR2    SIR    Program reads in a number of inches
               and outputs conversion to yards, 
               feet and inches.  Data is in SIR2DATA.
